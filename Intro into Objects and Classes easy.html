/* 
=[ JAVASCRIPT OBJECTS ]= 
An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality
	- Data is organized into key:value pairs much like an associate array, and each key can contain a single value, or multiple values (an actual array)
	- Functions can also be associated to an object, stored as a value (its key being how its called upon)

To begin an object, you must create a container to hold the data/functions, commonly this declare as a let or const. 
As a review: constants are block-scoped, much like variables defined using the let keyword. The contents of constant can be changed (added to array), and it can't be redeclared (same name used twice) or reassigned.

JavaScript Object Syntax:

const nameOf = {
	key1: "string value",
	key2: numeric,
	key3: boolean,
	key4: [ ],
	key5: function() { result; }
};

// === Storing Data and Data stricture ====
// The following is a JavaScript Object

const apple_device = {
		type: "phone",
		model_name: "Iphone 13 Pro Max",
		developer: "Apple Inc.",
		os: "iOS",
		storage: [64, 128, 256, 512],
		storagemin: function() {
			return this.storage[0] + "mb"
		}

	}
	
const android_device = {
		type: "phone",
		model_name: "Galaxy S24 Ultra",
		developer: "Samsung",
		os: "Android",
		storage: [64, 128, 256, 512],
		storagemin: function() {
			return this.storage[3] + "mb"
		}

	}





// Dot notation: How to access the object's properties and methods
// obj.property
// obj.method()


// A variable stored within a JS object is a PROPERTY of that object
// A function stored within a JS object is a METHOD of that object

document.getElementById('product').innerHTML = apple_device.model_name;
document.getElementById('company').innerHTML = apple_device.developer;
document.getElementById('os').innerHTML = apple_device.os;
document.getElementById("storage").innerHTML = apple_device.storagemin();
